Flight Booking Website Project
Project Overview:
The Flight Booking Website is a dynamic platform designed to facilitate the booking of flights for both companies and passengers. This application allows users to manage their profiles, view available flights, and handle bookings efficiently. It features user-friendly interfaces for both companies (airlines) and passengers, providing essential functionalities for flight management and reservation.

Key Features:

User Management:

Company Profile: Companies can register and manage their flight offerings. User data includes company name, bio, address, contact details, logo, and financial information. Each company can manage their flights and view passenger interactions.
Passenger Profile: Passengers can register with essential information, including name, email, password, contact number, passport details, and profile picture. They can track their flight history, including completed and pending flights.
Flight Management:

Each flight has associated details such as ID, itinerary, passenger count (registered and pending), fees, and scheduled times. Companies can add, edit, and cancel flights as needed, ensuring that all flight information is current and accurate.
User Registration & Login:

A simple registration process allows users to create accounts as either a company or a passenger. Upon registration, additional details can be captured based on user type. A secure login system ensures user data protection.
Interactive Pages:

Company Dashboard: Displays company logo, name, flight listings, and profile management options. It provides an overview of flights, allowing easy navigation to details, pending passenger lists, and cancellation options.
Passenger Dashboard: Offers a personalized view of the passenger's information, including completed flights and current bookings. Passengers can search for flights and view their profiles.
Flight Search Functionality:

A dedicated search feature enables passengers to find available flights by specifying their departure and arrival locations. The search results display a list of available flights with essential details.
Flight Information Page:

Detailed flight information, including itinerary, fees, and passenger options, is presented on this page. Passengers can choose to book a flight using available payment options, including using account funds or cash (with future implementation plans).
Messaging System:

A messaging feature allows passengers to communicate with the company for inquiries or support, enhancing user experience and engagement.
Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for a responsive user interface.
Backend: PHP with Laravel framework for server-side logic and database management.
